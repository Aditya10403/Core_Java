# Getting Started with Java üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

## Introduction to Java
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented.

## Types of Java Platforms
Java platforms are categorized into different editions, each serving different types of development needs:

- **`Java Standard Edition (Java SE)`**: This is the core Java programming platform. It provides the essential libraries and APIs for general-purpose development.
- **`Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)`**: Built on top of Java SE, this platform is used for developing large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications.
- **`Java Micro Edition (Java ME)`**: This edition is designed for resource-constrained devices such as embedded systems, mobile devices, and IoT devices.
- **`JavaFX`**: A platform for creating rich internet applications using a lightweight user interface API.

### Java Development Kit (JDK)
The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.

## Getting Started with Java Development
To start developing in Java, follow these steps:

1. **Install the JDK**: Download and install the latest JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Configure the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables to point to your JDK installation directory.
3. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Popular IDEs for Java development include [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
4. **Write Your First Java Program**: Create a simple "Hello, World!" program to verify your setup.

## Core Java Concepts
Core Java refers to the standard edition of Java (Java SE) and consists of the basic features of the Java programming language.

## <a name="a-object-oriented-programming-oop">A. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</a>

### 1. What is Java?
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented. The advantages of object-oriented software development include:
>- Modular development of code, which leads to easy maintenance and modification.
>- Reusability of code.
>- Improved reliability and flexibility of code.
>- Increased understanding of code.

### 2. What are the concepts of OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) includes:
>- Abstraction
>- Encapsulation
>- Polymorphism
>- Inheritance
>- Predefined types must be objects
>- User-defined types must be objects
>- Operations must be performed by sending messages to objects

### 3. Mention some features of Java
Some of the features which play an important role in the popularity of Java are as follows:
> - Object-Oriented
> - Platform independent
> - High Performance
> - Multithreaded
> - Portable
> - Secure

Sample code in Java:

```java
public class FirstProgram{
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Sita Ram üôè");  
    }  
}
```

## 4. Is Java 100% Object-oriented?
>Not 100%. Java does not satisfy all the OOP conditions because it uses eight primitive data types (Boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short) which are not objects.

## 5. What is Abstraction?
>Abstraction is the process of separating ideas from specific instances and thus, developing classes in terms of their own functionality, instead of their implementation details. Java supports the creation and existence of abstract classes that expose interfaces, without including the actual implementation of all methods. The abstraction technique aims to separate the implementation details of a class from its behavior.

`Abstract Class Person`

```java
public abstract class Person {  
    public abstract String getName(); 
}
```

Employee class extends the Abstract class Person. The method getName returns the name attribute of the employee.

`Employee Class`

```java
public class Employee extends Person {  
    private String name;
     
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    public static void main (String[] args) {  
        Employee employee = new Employee("John Wilson");
        System.out.println("Employee's Name "+ employee.getName()); 
         
        Person person = new Employee("Thomas Smith");
        System.out.println("Employee-Person's Name "+ person.getName());
    }  
}
```

## 6. What is Encapsulation?
>
> Encapsulation provides objects with the ability to hide their internal characteristics and behavior. Each object provides a number of methods, which can be accessed by other objects and change its internal data. In Java, there are three access modifiers: public, private, and protected. Each modifier imposes different access rights to other classes, either in the same or in external packages.

> Some advantages of using encapsulation are:
> - The internal state of every object is protected by hiding its attributes.
> - It increases usability and maintenance of code, because the behavior of an object can be independently changed or extended.
> - It improves modularity by preventing objects to interact with each other in an undesired way.

`Student Class`
```java
public class Student {  
    private int id;  
    private String name;  
    
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int getId() {
        return this.id;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        Student student = new Student();  
        student.setId(1034);
        student.setName("David Smith");
        
        System.out.println("Student id "+ student.getId());
        System.out.println("Student name "+ student.getName());
    }  
}  

```

## 7. What are the differences between Abstraction and Encapsulation?
> Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts. On the one hand, abstraction focuses on the behavior of an object. On the other hand, encapsulation focuses on the implementation of an object‚Äôs behavior. Encapsulation is usually achieved by hiding information about the internal state of an object and thus, can be seen as a strategy used in order to provide abstraction.

## 8. What is Polymorphism?
>`Polymorphism` is the ability of programming languages to present the same interface for differing underlying data types. A polymorphic type is a type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type.

You can see the example below where Vehicle interface has the method increaseVelocity. Truck, Train and Aeroplane implement the Vehicle Interface and the method increases the velocity to the appropriate velocity related to the vehicle type.

## 9. What are the types of Polymorphism?
>There are two types of Polymorphism in Java:
> - **Compile-time** polymorphism (`Static binding`) ‚Äì Method overloading
> - **Runtime** polymorphism (`Dynamic binding`) ‚Äì Method overriding
We can perform polymorphism by Method Overloading and Method Overriding.

### Compile-time vs. Runtime Polymorphism

| Feature                                      | Compile Time                                   | Runtime                                   |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Methods                                      | Methods of a class have the same name. Each method has a different number of parameters. It can have parameters with different types and order. | The subclass has a method with the name as of a superclass method. It has the number of parameters, type of parameters, and the return type as of a superclass method. |
| Method Behavior                              | Method Overloading is to add to the method‚Äôs behavior. It can be extending the method‚Äôs behavior. | Method Overriding is to modify the method‚Äôs behavior. |
| Method Signatures                            | Overloaded methods will not have the same signature. | Overridden methods will have exactly the same signature. |
| Inheritance Requirement                      | Inheritance is not needed in this case. | Inheritance is required. |

Sample code for overloading method subtract of Calculator Class is shown below:

`Calculator Class`
```java
public class Calculator {
 
    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
    
    public double subtract(double a, double b) {
        return a - b;
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Difference of 150 and 12 is " + calculator.subtract(150, 12));
        System.out.println("Difference of 15.5 and 15.4 is " + calculator.subtract(15.50, 15.40));
    }
}
```

Method overriding is shown below in Shape class. Shape has a method getArea.

`Shape Class`
```java
public class Shape {
    public void getArea() {
        System.out.println("Shape Area");
    }  
}
```

Rectangle class overrides getArea method and the implementation of the method is specific to Rectangle. Override annotation is used to indicate to the compiler that the method is overridden. Readability of the code is improved using the annotation.

`Rectangle Class`
```java
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
   
    @Override
    public void getArea() {
        System.out.println("Rectangle Area");
    }
   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Shape();
        shape.getArea();
     
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();  
        rectangle.getArea();  
    }
}
```

## 10. What is Inheritance?
> Inheritance provides an object with the ability to acquire the fields and methods of another class, called base class. Inheritance provides reusability of code and can be used to add additional features to an existing class, without modifying it.

Sample class Mammal is shown below which has a constructor.

`Mammal Class`
```java
public class Mammal {
    public Mammal() {
        System.out.println("Mammal created");
    }
}
```

Man class extends Mammal which has a default constructor. The sample code is shown below.

`Man Class`
```java
public class Man extends Mammal {
    public Man() {
        System.out.println("Man is created");
    }
}
```

Inheritance is tested by creating an instance of Man using default constructor. The sample code is shown to demonstrate the inheritance.

`TestInheritance`
```java
public class TestInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Man man = new Man();
    }
}
```

## 11. What is composition?
> Composition is exactly like Aggregation except that the lifetime of the ‚Äòpart‚Äô is controlled by the ‚Äòwhole‚Äô. This control may be direct or transitive. That is, the ‚Äòwhole‚Äô may take direct responsibility for creating or destroying the ‚Äòpart‚Äô, or it may accept an already created part, and later pass it on to some other whole that assumes responsibility for it.

Sample class Car is shown below to demonstrate Composition of tires, doors, windows and steering.

`Car Class`
```java
public class Car {
    private Tire[] tires;
    private Door[] doors;
    private Steering steering;
    private Window[] windows;
}

class Tire {
    // Tire properties and methods can be added here
}

class Door {
    // Door properties and methods can be added here
}

class Steering {
    // Steering properties and methods can be added here
}

class Window {
    // Window properties and methods can be added here
}
```

## 12. What is an association?
> Association represents the ability of one instance to send a message to another instance. This is typically implemented with a pointer or reference instance variable, although it might also be implemented as a method argument or the creation of a local variable.

## 13. What is aggregation?
> Aggregation is the typical whole/part relationship. This is exactly the same as an association with the exception that instances cannot have cyclic aggregation relationships.

Sample class Person is shown below to demonstrate Aggregation relationship with Address.

`Person Class`
```java
public class Person {
    private Address address;
}

class Address {
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String country;
    private String line1;
    private String line2;
    
    // Address properties and methods can be added here
}

```
