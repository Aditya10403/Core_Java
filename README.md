## Introduction to Java
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented.

## Types of Java Platforms
Java platforms are categorized into different editions, each serving different types of development needs:

- **`Java Standard Edition (Java SE)`**: Java SE lets you develop and deploy Java applications on desktops and servers. Java SE and component technologies offer the rich user interface, performance, versatility, portability, and security that today's applications require.
- **`Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)`**: Java EE provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running large, multi-tiered, reliable, and secure enterprise applications that are portable and scalable and that integrate easily with legacy applications and data.
- **`Java Micro Edition (Java ME)`**: Java ME Embedded is designed for resource-constrained devices like wireless modules for M2M, industrial control, smart-grid infrastructure, environmental sensors and tracking, and more.
- **`JavaFX`**: A platform for creating rich internet applications using a lightweight user interface API.

## Getting Started with Java Development
To start developing in Java, follow these steps:

1. **Install the JDK**: Download and install the latest JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Configure the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables to point to your JDK installation directory.
3. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Popular IDEs for Java development include [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

## Core Java Concepts
Core Java refers to the standard edition of Java (Java SE) and consists of the basic features of the Java programming language.

### <a name="1-what-is-java">What is Java?</a>
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented. The advantages of object-oriented software development are shown below:

- Modular development of code, which leads to easy maintenance and modification.
- Reusability of code.
- Improved reliability and flexibility of code.
- Increased understanding of code.

### <a name="2-features-of-java">Features of Java</a>
Some of the features which play an important role in the popularity of Java are as follows:

- Object-Oriented
- Platform independent
- High Performance
- Multithreaded
- Portable
- Secure

Sample code in Java:

```java
public class FirstProgram{
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Sita Ram üôè");  
    }  
}
```
